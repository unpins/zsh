/* unpin-vfs -- a single-binary virtual filesystem served from an embedded ZIP.
 *
 * One reusable core behind every unpin single-binary that embeds a runtime tree
 * (perl/biber @INC, python stdlib, tcc sysroot, vim runtime, ...). The tree is
 * a ZIP carried by the executable; a matched path under UNPIN_VFS_ROOT is
 * inflated on demand and handed to the program as a real, seekable fd. Misses
 * under the root are ENOENT (a reserved mount, never the host FS); everything
 * else falls through to libc untouched.
 *
 * Two ways the executable carries the ZIP:
 *   - blob (default): compiled in as a section (.incbin via blob.S), exposed
 *     through <sym>_{start,end} labels.
 *   - self-EOF (-DUNPIN_VFS_SELF): the single metadata/runtime ZIP appended to
 *     the binary by the nix build (docs/embedded-metadata.md — absolute,
 *     file-adjusted offsets). init locates the running executable, opens it
 *     read-only and serves entries straight from the file; the `unpin/` and
 *     `.unpin/` namespaces belong to unpin's metadata reader and are hidden
 *     from VFS lookups (the shared zstd dict is still auto-loaded).
 *
 * Container: a structurally standard .zip. Entries may be DEFLATE (method 8) or,
 * when built with -DMINIZ_USE_ZSTD, Zstandard (method 93) -- see README. An
 * optional shared zstd dictionary rides in the blob as the reserved STORED entry
 * ".unpin/zdict" and is auto-loaded at init.
 *
 * Two integration styles, one core:
 *   1. Transparent  -- GNU `ld --wrap` redirects libc open/stat/... into the
 *      __wrap_* shims below. No call-site edits (perl/biber/python/tcc/vim).
 *   2. Explicit API -- call unpin_vfs_* directly (for code paths --wrap can't
 *      reach). Both share the same lookup/inflate/materialise core.
 *
 * Build-time knobs (all optional):
 *   UNPIN_VFS_ROOT      mount prefix, default "/zip/"
 *   UNPIN_VFS_SELF      read the ZIP from the running executable's EOF instead
 *                       of a compiled-in blob (no blob.S, no *_start/_end syms)
 *   UNPIN_VFS_BLOB_SYM  blob symbol base name (bare identifier), default incblob
 *   MINIZ_USE_ZSTD      accept method-93 (zstd) entries + dict auto-load
 *   UNPIN_WRAP_TIME64   also wrap __stat_time64/__lstat_time64 (32-bit musl)
